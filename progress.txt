# Project Progress Log

## FILTER-001: Create task-based kanban HTML structure ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed:** February 11, 2026

### What was implemented:
- Replaced project card view with individual task card system
- Created status-based column organization: Todo, In Progress, Done, Blocked
- Task cards display all required information: ID, Title, Project, Owner, Priority, Status
- Added proper CSS classes for styling and filtering support
- Integrated with kanban-current-tasks.js data source
- Implemented search functionality for real-time task filtering
- Added priority indicators with color coding (critical=red, high=orange, medium=yellow, low=green)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Comprehensive test suite to verify all acceptance criteria

### Technical Implementation:
- HTML structure completely rewritten for task-based display
- JavaScript refactored to load and render individual tasks
- CSS redesigned with task-specific styling classes
- Search functionality supports ID, title, project, and owner filtering
- Dynamic task counting per status column
- Proper data attributes for future filtering functionality

### Acceptance Criteria Verification:
✅ HTML structure shows individual tasks instead of project cards
✅ Tasks organized in status-based columns: Todo, In Progress, Done, Blocked  
✅ Each task card displays: ID, Title, Project, Owner, Priority, Status
✅ Task cards have proper CSS classes for styling and filtering
✅ Page loads without JavaScript errors
✅ All task data from kanban-current-tasks.js renders correctly
✅ Typecheck passes (JavaScript syntax validated)

### Tests Created:
- simple-test.js: Comprehensive acceptance criteria validation
- test-structure.js: Detailed HTML and data structure verification
- Local server testing (python3 -m http.server) confirmed functionality

### Files Modified:
- index.html: Complete rewrite for task-based kanban
- Added test files for validation

### Codebase Patterns Discovered:

#### Task Card Structure Pattern:
```html
<div class="task-card" data-task-id="..." data-project="..." data-owner="..." data-priority="..." data-status="...">
    <div class="priority-indicator priority-{level}"></div>
    <div class="task-header">
        <div class="task-id">{ID}</div>
    </div>
    <div class="task-title">{Title}</div>
    <div class="task-meta">
        <div class="task-project">{Project}</div>
        <div class="task-owner">{Owner}</div>
        <div class="priority-label {level}">{Priority}</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### Status Column Organization Pattern:
- Use data-status attributes on columns for easy targeting
- Dynamic count updates via JavaScript
- Flexible column system supports adding new statuses

#### Data Loading Pattern:
- External JavaScript file (kanban-current-tasks.js) for data
- Runtime loading and rendering in DOM
- Separation of data and presentation for maintainability

#### Search/Filter Pattern:
- Data attributes on cards enable flexible filtering
- Real-time search without page reload
- Extensible for future advanced filtering features

- filter-controls-test.js: Comprehensive acceptance criteria testing
- All tests pass successfully

### Files Modified:
- index.html: Added filter controls UI, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality
- Added comprehensive test files for validation

### Codebase Patterns Updated:

#### Filter Control Pattern:
```html
<div class="filter-group">
    <label class="filter-label" for="filterName">Label</label>
    <div class="filter-dropdown" id="filterName" aria-label="Filter by type">
        <button class="filter-button" type="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
            <span class="filter-summary">All</span>
        </button>
        <div class="filter-options" role="listbox" aria-multiselectable="true">
            <!-- Populated by JavaScript -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### Filter State Management Pattern:
```javascript
activeFilters = {
    owner: [],
    project: [],
    priority: [],
    status: []
}
```

#### Responsive Filter Layout Pattern:
- Desktop: Horizontal flex layout with search + filters
- Mobile: Vertical stacked layout with search box first
- Dropdowns expand downward with scrollable options
